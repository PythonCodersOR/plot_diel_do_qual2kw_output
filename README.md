# plot_diel_do_qual2kw_output
Plot diel dissolved oxygen outputs from QUAL2Kw and compare the outputs with observed data on dissolved oxygen data.  This type of plot is useful for visualizing how well the model simulates DO dynamics in the system.  There are two files associated with this task: a text file with “messy” tables of model outputs and an excel file (which is obviously messy) with observed DO data.
